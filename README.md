# ADAS

Allow a rocket to change its target apogee by increasing or decreasing its cross sectional area

ADAS_feb05a.ino: initial adhoc skeleton
ADAS_feb19a.ino: hopefully optimized interrupt driven skeleton //should be faster

both still require functions to tell them how to actually control the control surfaces
